# Kovia App

Kovia App is a modern, full-stack web platform designed for live entertainers (performers, musicians, etc.) to easily collect fan contact information at events using personalized QR codes. The core value proposition is to enable performers to capture audience details securely and efficiently, provide links to their socials, and manage their contacts from a dashboardâ€”all without friction for the end user.

---

## Core Features

- **Performer Authentication (Email/Password):** Secure login and registration for performers.
- **Performer Dashboard:** Manage performer profile, view and manage captured contacts.
- **Personalized QR Code Generation:** Each performer gets a unique QR code linking to their public contact capture page.
- **Public Contact Capture Page:** `/c/[username]` route where fans submit their info.
- **Firestore Data Storage:** Performer profiles and captured contacts are stored in Firebase Cloud Firestore.
- **Basic Admin Dashboard:** Placeholder for admin user listing (future work required for full functionality).
- **Contact Data Details:** Contact info is normalized (first/last name, email, phone, ZIP, state).
- **Post-Submission Redirect:** Performers can configure a redirect URL after fans submit their info.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** Next.js (App Router), React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Shadcn UI, Zod (schema validation), React Hook Form (form management)
- **Backend/Data:** Firebase (Authentication, Firestore). Cloud Functions are planned for secure public writes.
- **Development:** npm/yarn, Git

---
*   **Contact Capture Page:** A public-facing page (accessed via `/c/[username]`) where audience members can submit their name, email, phone (optional), and ZIP code (optional).
*   **Data Storage:** Performer profiles and captured contacts are stored securely in Firestore.
*   **Admin Dashboard (Basic):** A simple view for administrators to see registered users (placeholder, requires backend logic for full user listing).
*   **ZIP Code Lookup:** Automatically determines the state based on the entered ZIP code on the capture form.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

*   Node.js (LTS version recommended)
*   npm or yarn
*   Firebase Account and Project

### Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <your-repository-url>
    cd kovia-connect
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    # or
    yarn install
    ```

3.  **Set up Firebase:**
    *   Create a Firebase project at [https://console.firebase.google.com/](https://console.firebase.google.com/).
    *   Enable Firestore (Native mode), Authentication (Email/Password), and Hosting.
    *   In your Firebase project settings, go to the "General" tab.
    *   Under "Your apps", click the Web (`</>`) icon to register a new web app.
    *   Copy the `firebaseConfig` object provided.

4.  **Configure Environment Variables:**
    *   Copy the example environment file:
        ```bash
        cp .env.example .env.local
        ```
    *   Open `.env.local` and paste your Firebase configuration values from the previous step. Ensure the variable names match those in `src/lib/firebase.ts` (e.g., `NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY`).
    *   **Important:** `.env.local` is included in `.gitignore` to prevent committing your secret keys.
    *   **Crucial:** After editing `.env.local`, **you must restart your Next.js development server** for the changes to take effect (stop the `npm run dev` process and run it again).

5.  **(Optional) Seed Initial Data:**
    *   You can manually add the initial performer data to your Firestore database as described in the original prompt (for user `louisJohnson`). Go to your Firestore console, create the `performers` collection, add a document with the ID `louisJohnson`, and populate the fields. Alternatively, adapt the dashboard creation logic to handle initial data setup if needed.

### Running Locally

1.  **Start the development server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    # or
    yarn dev
    ```
    This will start the Next.js development server, typically on `http://localhost:9002`. Check your terminal and browser console for any Firebase configuration errors.

### Running in Firebase Studio (if applicable)

The `dev` script is configured to run the application within the Firebase Studio environment. The Studio environment typically handles setting the `PORT` and `HOST` environment variables.

1.  Ensure your Firebase project is linked to your Studio workspace.
2.  Use the Studio interface to run the development server. It should execute the `npm run dev` (or `yarn dev`) script.
3.  Access the preview URL provided by Firebase Studio.

### Building for Production

```bash
npm run build
# or
yarn build
```
This command builds the application for production usage. Ensure environment variables are correctly configured in your production environment.

### Linting

```bash
npm run lint
# or
yarn lint
```
This command runs the Next.js linter to check code quality.
